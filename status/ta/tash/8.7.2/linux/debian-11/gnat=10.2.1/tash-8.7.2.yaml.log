   Long_Description: Tash (previously known as Tcl Ada Shell) is an Ada binding to Tcl/Tk.

Its purpose is to

* allow a Tcl program to use Ada in place of C to implement Tcl
  commands where additional execution speed, more complex data
  structures, or better name space management is needed, and

* support the rapid development of Platform-Independent Graphical User
  Interfaces via Tk.

Please note that, on macOS, tash assumes that Tcl/Tk is provided via
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
