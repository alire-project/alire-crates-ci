- 'SOLUTION:

  '
- 'si_units=0.2.0: Pretty print physical values in properly scaled metric (SI) units.

  '
- 'Origin: commit 13606e4922ac7c1dc9e456db9967a057ced1e9ea from https://github.com/HeisenbugLtd/si_units.git

  '
- 'Properties:

  '
- '   Author: Vinzent "Jellix" Saranen

  '
- '   Description: Pretty print physical values in properly scaled metric (SI) units.

  '
- '   GPR Scenario: SI_UNITS_BUILD_MODE := debug | release

  '
- '   License: WTFPL

  '
- '   Long_Description: Provides generic conversion (`Image`) functions that convert
  values into human

  '
- 'readable strings with appropriate SI prefixes. This is especially convenient

  '
- 'when you have to deal with printing values from a potentially large interval,

  '
- 'and you need to represent such values as something an average human will

  '
- 'easily be able to read. Then you can use `SI_Units` to take care of the

  '
- 'conversion into an appropriate string representation for you.

  '
- '

  '
- 'Converting values into a string is supported with all SI prefixes which are a

  '
- 'power of 1000 (yocto .. Yotta), additionally there is a generic that can deal

  '
- 'with binary prefixes (i.e. prefixes that denote powers of 1024).

  '
- '

  '
- 'Scaling (i.e. conversion between different prefixes, like from kilo(meter) to

  '
- 'centi(meter)) between all defined SI prefixes is also supported, similar for

  '
- 'binary prefixes.

  '
- '

  '
- 'See the project''s [website](https://github.heisenbug.eu/si_units) for more

  '
- 'details.

  '
- '

  '
- 'Version 0.2.0 is source code identical to the previous 0.1.3 release, but adds

  '
- 'full support for Alire integration. In the process, the provided `gnat` project

  '
- 'files have been streamlined, so if you upgrade to this version from a previous

  '
- 'release, you will need to adjust your own project files accordingly.
