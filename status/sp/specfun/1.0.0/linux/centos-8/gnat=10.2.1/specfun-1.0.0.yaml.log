specfun=1.0.0: Native Ada library of special functions (e.g., beta, gamma)
Origin: commit b702d270ca6e1ffb272aa2faa3fc8626ee4739a0 from https://gitlab.com/my-ada-library/specfun.git

   Author: Riccardo Bernardini
   Description: Native Ada library of special functions (e.g., beta, gamma)
   License: MIT
   Long_Description: This is a small native Ada library that provides few special functions like Beta, Gamma and Beta Incomplete. I wrote this because I needed those functions, therefore at the moment only the functions that I needed are present. This is a pure native Ada library and there is no dependence on external FORTRAN libraries.
