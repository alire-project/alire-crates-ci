SOLUTION:
spark_unbound=0.2.1: Unbound data structures in Ada-Spark
Origin: commit 1f8dae0167b56dbbfcc0cbe40c833a95443d2556 from https://github.com/mhatzl/spark_unbound.git

   Author: Manuel Hatzl
   Description: Unbound data structures in Ada-Spark
   License: MIT
   Long_Description: Spark_Unbound is a take on providing generic unbound data structures in Spark.

In addition to proving general absence of runtime errors, the heap allocation is done in a non-Spark function to catch a possible `Storage_Error`.
This further increases the security and confident use of this library.

**The following packages are currently available:**

- `Spark_Unbound.Safe_Alloc`: Providing formally proven safe heap allocation functionality
- `Spark_Unbound.Arrays`: Providing a formally proven alternative to `Ada.Containers.Vector`

**Note:** If you use this library, starring the repository on GitHub helps me a lot to see if it is even useful for someone else.
