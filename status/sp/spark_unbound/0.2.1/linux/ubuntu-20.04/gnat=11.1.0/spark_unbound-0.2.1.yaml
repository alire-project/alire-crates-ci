- 'SOLUTION:

  '
- 'spark_unbound=0.2.1: Unbound data structures in Ada-Spark

  '
- 'Origin: commit 1f8dae0167b56dbbfcc0cbe40c833a95443d2556 from https://github.com/mhatzl/spark_unbound.git

  '
- 'Properties:

  '
- '   Author: Manuel Hatzl

  '
- '   Description: Unbound data structures in Ada-Spark

  '
- '   License: MIT

  '
- '   Long_Description: Spark_Unbound is a take on providing generic unbound data
  structures in Spark.

  '
- '

  '
- 'In addition to proving general absence of runtime errors, the heap allocation is
  done in a non-Spark function to catch a possible `Storage_Error`.

  '
- 'This further increases the security and confident use of this library.

  '
- '

  '
- '**The following packages are currently available:**

  '
- '

  '
- '- `Spark_Unbound.Safe_Alloc`: Providing formally proven safe heap allocation functionality

  '
- '- `Spark_Unbound.Arrays`: Providing a formally proven alternative to `Ada.Containers.Vector`

  '
- '

  '
- '**Note:** If you use this library, starring the repository on GitHub helps me a
  lot to see if it is even useful for someone else.
