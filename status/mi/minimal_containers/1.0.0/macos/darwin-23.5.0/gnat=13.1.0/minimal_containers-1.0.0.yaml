  '
- 'minimal_containers=1.0.0: Much reduced version of Ada.Containers (bounded Maps,
  Vectors)

  '
- 'Origin: commit 592661c64b8ad6fa40864e9584a8faa3a1d2b283 from https://github.com/simonjwright/minimal_containers.git

  '
- 'Properties:

- '   Author: Simon Wright

  '
- '   Description: Much reduced version of Ada.Containers (bounded Maps, Vectors)

  '
- '   License: GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1

  '
- '   Long_Description: The motivation for these containers was use in [ColdFrame](https://simonjwright.github.io/coldframe/),
  an open-source code generator backend for use with UML tools in a restricted environment
  (a BBC micro:bit).

  '
- '

  '
- 'In such an environment, it''s normal to strip out unused code and data at link
  time (`-gc-sections` with GNU `ld`, `-dead_strip` with Apple `ld`).

  '
- '

  '
- 'Unfortunately, it turns out that no primitive subprograms of tagged types can be
  stripped (they are all referenced by the dispatch table).

  '
- '

  '
- 'These containers are still tagged, because (without compiler extensions) ColdFrame
  expects to use prefixed notation (_object_._primitive subprogram (...)_, as would
  users). However, the number of subprograms has been much reduced.
