- "minimal_containers=1.0.0: Much reduced version of Ada.Containers (bounded Maps,\
  \ Vectors)\r\n"
- "Origin: commit 592661c64b8ad6fa40864e9584a8faa3a1d2b283 from https://github.com/simonjwright/minimal_containers.git\r\
  \n"
- "Properties:\r\n"
- "   Author: Simon Wright\r\n"
- "   Description: Much reduced version of Ada.Containers (bounded Maps, Vectors)\r\
  \n"
- "   License: GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1\r\n"
- "   Long_Description: The motivation for these containers was use in [ColdFrame](https://simonjwright.github.io/coldframe/),\
  \ an open-source code generator backend for use with UML tools in a restricted environment\
  \ (a BBC micro:bit).\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "In such an environment, it's normal to strip out unused code and data at link time\
  \ (`-gc-sections` with GNU `ld`, `-dead_strip` with Apple `ld`).\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Unfortunately, it turns out that no primitive subprograms of tagged types can be\
  \ stripped (they are all referenced by the dispatch table).\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "These containers are still tagged, because (without compiler extensions) ColdFrame\
  \ expects to use prefixed notation (_object_._primitive subprogram (...)_, as would\
  \ users). However, the number of subprograms has been much reduced.\r\n"
