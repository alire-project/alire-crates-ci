  '
- '# How to setup the Ada development environment for the Micro:Bit

  '
- '

  '
- 'GNAT Community now comes with micro:bit and pyOCD support built-in. So you only

  '
- 'need to download the ARM ELF and the native package from

  '
- '[here](https://www.adacore.com/download)

  '
- '

  '
- '## pyOCD programmer

  '
- '

  '
- 'The Micro:Bit comes with an embedded programming/debugging probe implementing

  '
- 'the

  '
- '[CMSIS-DAP](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/advanced/DAP/)

  '
- 'protocol defined by ARM.

  '
- '

  '
- 'To use it on Linux, you might need privileges to access the USB ports without

  '
- 'which the flash program will say "No connected boards".

  '
- '

  '
- 'On Ubuntu, you can do it by creating (as administrator) the file

  '
- '/etc/udev/rules.d/mbed.rules and add the line:

  '
- '```

  '
- 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0d28", ATTR{idProduct}=="0204", MODE="0666"

  '
- '```

  '
- 'then restarting the service by doing

  '
- '

  '
- '```shell

  '
- '$ sudo udevadm trigger

  '
- '```

  '
- '

  '
- '## Open one of example projects and build it

  '
- '

  '
- 'Start GNAT Programming studio (GPS) with Alire and one micro:bit example

  '
- 'project:

  '
- '

  '

  '

  '
- 'Press F4 and then press Enter to build the project.

  '
- '

  '
- '## Program the board

  '
- '

  '
- 'Plug your micro:bit board with a USB cable, and wait for the system to

  '
- 'recognize it. This can take a few seconds

  '
- '

  '
- 'In the GPS toolbar, click on the "flash to board" button to program the

  '
- 'micro:bit.

  '
- '

  '
- 'After a few seconds, you should see a text scrolling on the LED matrix.

  '
- '

  '
- 'That''s it, you are ready to hack the micro:bit with Ada!
