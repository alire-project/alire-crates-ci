SOLUTION:
scripted_testing=2.0.0: Integration testing
Origin: commit 6720b9250e31c58d150d52c554193e22767a0704 from https://github.com/simonjwright/scripted_testing.git

   Description: Integration testing
   License: GPL-3.0-or-later
   Long_Description: To set the scene, the Ada software under test (SUT) forms part of a system. Generally, the system will be constructed using a layered approach, and the other parts of the system that interact with the SUT are higher-level (which can call interface subprograms presented by the SUT) or lower-level (whose interfaces can be called by the SUT, or which can provide callbacks to the SUT).

This package is intended for testing at a level between unit testing (using, for example, [AUnit](https://github.com/AdaCore/aunit)) and integration testing (using real hardware). Unit testing tends to be fragile, requiring a lot of rework for even minor functional changes in the requirements.

The scripting language supported is [Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk), and specifically the Ada binding [Tash](https://github.com/simonjwright/tcladashell). The reason for choosing Tcl rather than Python or Lua is that Tcl's interface is entirely string-based; this is important, considering the need to specify values of enumerated types.

The package provides facilities to write new commands in Tcl to

* call the interface subprograms presented by the SUT,

* set up values to be returned by calls the SUT makes to lower-level system components,

* call callbacks provided by lower-level system components,

* delay for appropriate periods, and

* check that the proper calls have been made to lower-level system components, with the required values.

It's assumed that the interface subprograms of the lower-level subsystems are stubbed so that:

* `in` and `in out` parameters can be recorded for later checking,

* `out` (and `in out`) parameter values and function `return` values can be provided to be returned to the SUT,

* exceptions can be raised when required,

* the number of calls to the subprogram can be checked.
