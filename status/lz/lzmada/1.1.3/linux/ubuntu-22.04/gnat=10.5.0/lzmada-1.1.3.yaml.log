   Long_Description: A very thin Ada binding for the LZMA compression library.
Roughly speaking, import some package:

    with Lzma.Base;
    with Lzma.Container;
    with Lzma.Check;

Then declare the LZMA stream:

    Stream  : aliased Lzma.Base.lzma_stream := Lzma.Base.LZMA_STREAM_INIT;

Initialize the LZMA stream as decoder (or as encoder):

    Result := Lzma.Container.lzma_stream_decoder (Stream'Unchecked_Access,
                                                  Long_Long_Integer'Last,
                                                  Lzma.Container.LZMA_CONCATENATED);

Setup the stream 'next_out', 'avail_out', 'next_in' and 'avail_in' and call
the lzma_code operation with the action (Lzma.Base.LZMA_RUN or Lzma.Base.LZMA_FINISH):

    Result := Lzma.Base.lzma_code (Stream'Unchecked_Access, Action);

Close the LZMA stream:

    Lzma.Base.lzma_end (Stream'Unchecked_Access);
