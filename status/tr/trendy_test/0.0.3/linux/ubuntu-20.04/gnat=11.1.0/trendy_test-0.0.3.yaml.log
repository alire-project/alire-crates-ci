Minimum Effort Ada Unit Testing Library

[![Build Status](https://github.com/pyjarrett/trendy_test/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pyjarrett/trendy_test/actions)

## Features

- Minimum setup
- Parallelization of tests
- Randomization of test order to find dependencies between tests
- No generated code or scripts needed

## Example

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Trendy_Test;
with Trendy_Test.Assertions.Integer_Assertions;
with Trendy_Test.Reports;

use Trendy_Test.Assertions;
use Trendy_Test.Assertions.Integer_Assertions;

procedure My_Test_Main is
begin
    Trendy_Test.Register (My_Tests.All_Tests);
    Trendy_Test.Reports.Print_Basic_Report(Trendy_Test.Run);
end My_Test_Main;

----------------------------------------------------------------

with Trendy_Test;
package My_Tests is
    function All_Tests return Trendy_Test.Test_Group;
end Trendy_Command_Line_Tests;

----------------------------------------------------------------

package body My_Tests is
    procedure Test_Sample (T : in out Trendy_Test.Operation'Class) is
    begin
        -- Don't put anything above here you don't want run during listing/other ops.
        T.Register;
        Assert (T, Some_Expression);
    end Test_Sample;

    procedure Test_Is_Disabled (T : in out Trendy_Test.Operation'Class) is
    begin
        T.Register(Disabled => True);  -- Disabled, don't run this test.
        Assert (T, Some_Expression);
    end Test_Sample;

    procedure Test_Is_Not_Run_In_Parallel (T : in out Trendy_Test.Operation'Class) is
    begin
        T.Register(Parallelize => False);  -- There's some dependency, so don't run it in parallel.
        Assert (T, Some_Expression);
    end Test_Sample;

    function All_Tests return Trendy_Test.Test_Group is
    begin
        return
            (Test_Sample'Access,
             Test_Is_Disabled'Access
            );
    end All_Tests;
end My_Tests;
```
