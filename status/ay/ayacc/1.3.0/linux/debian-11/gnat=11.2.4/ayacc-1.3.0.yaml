  '
- '   Long_Description: Ayacc is an Ada parser generator in the style of yacc(1).

  '
- '

  '
- 'The first implementation was written by David Taback and Deepak Tolani

  '
- 'at the University of California, Irvine.  The last version that was released

  '
- 'appeared to be the Ayacc 1.1 released in 1994.

  '
- '

  '
- 'Ayacc was used and improved by P2Ada, the Pascal to Ada translator.

  '
- 'This version of Ayacc is derived from the P2Ada ayacc implementation

  '
- 'released in August 2010.

  '
- '

  '
- 'This version brings a number of improvements:

  '
- '

  '
- '- Ayacc now uses more standard options to configure the code generation

  '
- '- The parser was improved to configure the parser stack size and

  '
- '  support Ada child packages.

  '
- '- The grammar supports the %unit directive to control the Ada child packages.

  '
- '- Several options provide a better control of the generated code.
