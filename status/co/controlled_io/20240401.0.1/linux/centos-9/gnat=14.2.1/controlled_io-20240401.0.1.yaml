  '
- 'This is a draft response to a request for a library for [Scope-based files](https://forum.ada-lang.io/t/ada-library-wishlist/14/5).
  Both binary and text I/O is supported. Please comment on whether or not you find
  this useful.

  '
- '

  '
- 'The library is completely portable. It has been compiled and tested with GNAT and
  ObjectAda, on Linux and Windows.

  '
- '

  '
- 'Controlled_Test and Controlled_Text are test programs. Both are user-unfriendly
  file-copy programs. Controlled_Test performs a binary copy; the output should always
  be identical to the input. Controlled_Text performs a line-by-line copy of text
  files; the output may have different line terminators than the input.

  '
- '

  '
- 'Controlled_UTF is a user-unfriendly program to convert a native text file to a
  [Universal Text File](https://github.com/jrcarter/Universal-Text-File).
